      experience using it in their daily lives.

    <p>
      With LLM's (henceforth AI) in the spotlight - blowing minds, raking
      venture capital and promoting existential crises - I am curious: how good
      is this? Is it really able to replicate a thought process without the time
      and training that I have invested in?
